# Configuration Hardening Assessment PowerShell Script (CHAPS)

CHAPS is a PowerShell script for checking system security settings where additional software and assessment tools, such as Microsoft Policy Analyzer, cannot be installed. The purpose of this script is to run it on a server or workstation to collect configuration information about that system. The information collected can then be used to provide recommendations (and references) to improve the security of the individual system and systemic issues within the organization's Windows environment. Examples of environments where this script is useful include Industrial Control System (ICS) environments where systems cannot be modified. These systems include Engineer / Operator workstations, Human Machine Interface (HMI) systems, and management servers that are deployed in production environments.
